Productivity and Photo/Video:

- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/): Lightweight photo editor very photoshop-esque but works smoothly and for much less money.
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/)

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org): SVG editor, recently released v1.0
- [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com): Probably my favourite Markdown editor on Mac - the recent update has fixed a flicker issue, and it's more lightweight and faster than other versions I've tried.
- [TexPad](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/texpad-latex-editor/id458866234?mt=12): Not a free editor, but is really pretty and nice to use for smaller projects.

- [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12): Nice snap-to-corner window manager making it a bit more windows-esque, free alternative is [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com).
- [Lungo](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app-bundle/sindres-menu-bar-bundle/id1439413445?mt=12): Keeps your mac on permanently if you need to run renders etc. while AFK.

- [Karibiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org): Karibiner does desktop shortcuts. I've used it almost exclusively to map my mouse keys to switch between virtual desktops (workspaces), because I realised I use that a LOT when I was working with a touchpad.
- [Colormate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colormate-picker-organizer/id1514980873?mt=12): Allows picking colours and copying them from anywhere on the screen - has turned out to be incredibly useful!

- [Adblocker Plus](https://adblockplus.org): "Surf the web with no annoying ads" - lets me turn on and off ad blocking for each website.
- [Monit](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/monit/id1014850245?mt=12): See key peformance data in the notification centre.
- [TinkerTool](https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html): Access to additional preference settings Apple has built into macOS.
- [Mos](https://mos.caldis.me): Smooth scrolling with the mouse on mac! I wish apple built this in automatically...
- [ViMac](https://vimacapp.com): Keyboard scrolling, replaces little shortcuts and checkboxes with letter keys, makes it super easy to use vim-like shortcuts in most of the mac environment.
