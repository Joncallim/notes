# Mac Software - Introduction

There is an absolute **ton** of great software out there. I've put a list together here with my favourite little bits of software, partially for my own reference, and partially because I think people should all experience these awesome software.

I've broken them up into a few simple sections:

1. [Design](#design)

2. [Writing](#Writing)

3. [Media](#Media)

4. [System Modifications](#System-Modifications)

5. [Hardware](#Hardware)

6. [Games](#Games)

7. [Programming](#Programming)

8. [Python Libraries](#Python-Libraries)

# Design

I don't really use these extensively. I got Affinity on a **huge** discount, and prefer the fact that it's a one-time-payment as opposed to Adobe's equivalent.

- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/): Lightweight photo editor very photoshop-esque but works smoothly and for much less money.
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/)
- [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/)
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org): SVG editor, recently released v1.0

# Writing

Sometimes I jot down notes in markdown, and sometimes I take a bit more time to compose a letter or paper in LaTeX. If you haven't heard of MarkDown, get your head out of the ground! 

#### Latex

- [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/obtaining.html): The MacTeX editor of choice. The interface is a little old-school, but together with [Hungrymark](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/hungrymark/id1482778901?mt=12) and [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12), I've got a pretty good workflow going.

- [TexPad](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/texpad-latex-editor/id458866234?mt=12): Not a free editor, but very pretty, and works well for tiny projects. It's a bit more finnicky when you're trying to make fine-detail adjustments, but for general-purpose writing it's great.

#### Markdown

- [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com): One of my favourite Markdown editors on Mac.

- [MarkText](https://marktext.app): Windows and Linux versions available too. This is basically a WYSIWYG editor, but tends to be.

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md): A *very* pretty interface for taking notes in Markdown. I don't really use it at the moment, but I have it on this list in case I want to try!

#### Text Editor

- [Atom](https://atom.io): The hackable text editor for the 21st Century

---

# Media

#### Social Media

- [Zoom](https://zoom.us)
- [Whatsapp Desktop](https://www.whatsapp.com/download)
- [Telegram Lite](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/telegram-lite/id946399090?mt=12)
- [Discord](https://discord.com)
- [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/desktop)
- [Franz](https://meetfranz.com): Franz is a messaging app for WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram and many many more. Free version lets you add 3 services, but you can pay for more.

#### Entertainment

- [Clicker for Netflix](https://www.dbklabs.com/clicker-for-netflix/): Netflix viewer. I don't really use this that much...

- [Voxal](https://www.nchsoftware.com/voicechanger/index.html): Nice and free audio changer - fun to use in Discord etc.

- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/uk/download/mac/): I actually use Apple Music, but Spotify sits in the background in case I can't find something on Apple Music.

- [Splashy](https://splashy.art): Wallpaper changer! There's a free version and it works nicely in the background!

---

# Safari

Safari is my browser of choice - I've just gotten used to it over time, after moving away from Google Chrome, and can't really be bothered to try out Firefox at the moment. These are the extensions I use (on a regular basis).

#### Extensions

- [Pipifier for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/pipifier-pip-for-nearly-every-video/id1160374471?mt=12): Allows for Picture-in-picture views in Netflix and *most* other websites.

- [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html): After going through a bunch of different ad blockers, this has turned out to be by far the best. Although I use the system-wide version (that's paid), you can also use [â€ŽAdGuard for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/adguard-for-safari/id1440147259?mt=12), available on the App Store.

- [uTorrent Web]([Î¼TorrentÂ® (uTorrent) - a (very) tiny BitTorrent client](https://www.utorrent.com)): Bittorrent client of choice. It runs inside Safari, and is nice and super lightweight.

- [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com): This needs to be added to Safari/Chrome...

#### Other

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwlZf3BRABEiwA8Q0qq1U6FBS7dI6rz1GcJLd2BwiHtOp5P_oOO9Otw7YVDWN-0PnIEIEDnxoCtK8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds): I like Safari - it's fast and lightweight, but some things just run on Chrome and nothing else.

- [VPN Unlimited](https://www.vpnunlimitedapp.com): VPN Client of choice, mostly because I got the lifetime subscription for cheap. This runs system-wide and not just in Safari, so it works with all other apps too.

# System Modifications

#### Regular Use

These are little mods that you'll use right up front (with keyboard shortcuts or the like) they change workflows a little.

- [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12): Nice snap-to-corner window manager making it a bit more windows-esque, free alternative is [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com).

- [Monit](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/monit/id1014850245?mt=12): See key peformance data in the notification centre.

- [Colormate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colormate-picker-organizer/id1514980873?mt=12): Allows picking colours and copying them from anywhere on the screen - has turned out to be incredibly useful!

- [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app): The shortcut âŒ˜+â‡§+2 lets you select an area of your screen and converts images to text very quickly and actually fairly accurately.

- [Hungrymark](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/hungrymark/id1482778901?mt=12): Really cool bookmark button for websites, files, apps, lots of things you can use!

- [ViMac](https://vimacapp.com): Keyboard scrolling, replaces little shortcuts and checkboxes with letter keys, makes it super easy to use vim-like shortcuts in most of the mac environment.

- [Cheatsheet](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/43222/cheatsheet): Hold down âŒ˜ to view all shortcuts in basically any app or screen in your mac

- [Dato](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12): Fairly convenient clock/calendar replacement that offers good customisation.

#### Background

These exist in the background a little more - you'll probably notice they're gone more than you'll notice than they're around, but YMMV.

- [Glance]([GitHub - samuelmeuli/glance: ðŸ”Ž All-in-one Quick Look plugin](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/glance)): Gives some much nicer markup for things like Python/Markdown files.

- [BlackHole]([GitHub - ExistentialAudio/BlackHole: BlackHole is a modern macOS virtual audio driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency.](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)): BlackHole is a modern MacOS virtual audio driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency.

- [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12):Keeps your mac on permanently if you need to run renders etc. while AFK, with pretty good granular control. A paid alternative I've used before is [Lungo](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app-bundle/sindres-menu-bar-bundle/id1439413445?mt=12).

- [Karibiner-Elements]([Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org)): Karibiner does desktop shortcuts. I've used it almost exclusively to map my mouse keys to switch between virtual desktops (workspaces), because I realised I use that a LOT when I was working with a touchpad.

- [Mos](https://mos.caldis.me): Smooth scrolling with the mouse on mac! I wish apple built this in automatically...

#### Utility

These bits do maintenance and help to run other little things that might be used once every few days/weeks.

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org): Virtual Machine, good to run Windows when compiling for some binaries or other.

- [Onyx](https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html): Use for maintenance/cleaning tasks.

- [CleanMyMacX](https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac): I'm a sucker for clean interfaces and lightweight software. CleanMyMacX removes bloat fairly quickly and you can either get it with SetApp or buy an individual subscription/pay a lifetime fee.

- [TinkerTool](https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html): Access to additional preference settings Apple has built into macOS.

- [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/app/thanks): Basically a native translation interface that uses DeepL - with a nice clean interface.

- [CleanShotX](https://cleanshot.com): Great screenshotting interface. I like the native interface but things like scrolling capture have turned out to be pretty great additions.

- [Aerial](https://github.com/glouel/AerialCompanion/releases/latest/download/AerialInstaller.dmg): Screensaver application that lets you play Aerial videos from Apple's tvOS screensaver.

---

# Hardware

These are either drivers or software that works specifically with certain hardware.

- [Veikk Drivers](https://www.veikk.com/nav/14.html): Download for the super cheap drawing tablet I bought.

- [Repaper Studio](https://www.iskn.co/repaper/app/): I use this with the Slate - probably not for everyone else.

- [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/): Can be used to write image files to MicroSD cards. I use this with Raspberry Pi projects.

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software): The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload it to the board.

# Games

#### "Traditional" Gaming Platforms

Gaming on mac isn't really all that great, but you can have fun too!

- [Battle.net](https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/?ref=battle.net): Starcraft II runs on Mac (in Metal), and is pretty slick.

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com): If you're coming from a windows gaming machine, it is likely you'd be able to find some games already written for Metal, or ported for Mac by [Feral Interactive](https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/).

#### Apple Arcade

I thought Apple Arcade was a waste of time when it first came out, but it turns out casual gaming was exactly what I needed to kill time when I *really* don't feel like playing a real game or reading a book. My current playlist:

- [Butter Royale]((https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/butter-royale/id1464649839?mt=12): Genuinely a great little battle royale game that's not at all difficult to pick up and mess around with!

- [â€ŽOceanhorn 2](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/oceanhorn-2/id1460715987?mt=12): Honestly, this is just a fantastic game.

- [â€ŽOverland](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/overland/id1467652041?mt=12): I am a *sucker* for turn-based strategy, and the fact that this game is hair-pullingly difficult is even better!

---

# Programming

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com): Python distribution of choice - I also prefer Spyder over Pycharm.
- [PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac): Other Python
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com): Use to manage and push updates to github repos.
- [Kite](https://kite.com): Great little tool to do autocomplete in lots of editors.
- [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com)

# Python Libaries

I use python for quick-and-dirty jobs. These libraries are either ML stuff (I've taken an interest in it, or other utility libraries I've found useful in work/play) that I wouldn't remember exist normally (obviously numpy needs no introduction).

- [PlaidML](https://plaidml.github.io/plaidml/): Tensor Compiler for any old graphics card - much faster than just chugging along with a slow CPU.
- [PDF2SVG](http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg/): Converts any old PDFs to vector graphics - has turned out to be super useful.
- [PyFiglet](https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet/tree/master/pyfiglet/fonts): Great little library to make cool header text.
- [Cowsay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay): Another great little cool ASCII art text library.
