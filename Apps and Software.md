# Mac Software - Introduction

There is an absolute **ton** of great software out there. I've put a list together here with my favourite little bits of software, partially for my own reference, and partially because I think people should all experience these awesome software.

I've broken them up into a few simple sections:

# Writing

Sometimes I jot down notes in markdown, and sometimes I take a bit more time to compose a letter or paper in LaTeX.

#### Latex

- [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/obtaining.html): The MacTeX editor of choice. The interface is a little old-school, but together with [Hungrymark](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/hungrymark/id1482778901?mt=12) and [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12), I've got a pretty good workflow going.
- [TexPad](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/texpad-latex-editor/id458866234?mt=12): Not a free editor, but very pretty, and works well for tiny projects. It's a bit more finnicky when you're trying to make fine-detail adjustments, but for general-purpose writing it's great.

#### Markdown

- [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com): One of my favourite Markdown editors on Mac.
- [MarkText](https://marktext.app): Windows and Linux versions available too. This is basically a WYSIWYG editor, but tends to be.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md): A *very* pretty interface for taking notes in Markdown. I don't really use it at the moment, but I have it on this list in case I want to try!

#### Text Editor

- [Atom](https://atom.io): The hackable text editor for the 21st Century. *Update: Atom is no longer supported by GitHub. I have not yet found a clean replacement.*

---

# Media

#### Social Media

- [Zoom](https://zoom.us)
- [Whatsapp Desktop](https://www.whatsapp.com/download)
- [Telegram Lite](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/telegram-lite/id946399090?mt=12)
- [Discord](https://discord.com)
- [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/desktop)

#### Entertainment
- [Voxal](https://www.nchsoftware.com/voicechanger/index.html): Nice and free audio changer - fun to use in Discord etc.
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/uk/download/mac/): I actually use Apple Music, but Spotify sits in the background in case I can't find something on Apple Music.
- [Splashy](https://splashy.art): Wallpaper changer! There's a free version and it works nicely in the background!

### Photography
I take a bunch of photos on a tiny little OM Systems OM-1 (actually, not that tiny). These bits of software are specific to my workflow, but hopefully you can find something useful too.

- [RAW Power](https://www.gentlemencoders.com/raw-power-for-macos/) a professional image editor app and Apple Photos extension (this part is really important). You can edit RAW photos directly from Apple Photos, using Apple's Native RAW Decoder.
- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/): Lightweight photo editor very photoshop-esque but works smoothly and for much less money. Affinity plugs in directly into Apple Photos, so is also really useful if your workflow involves Apple Photos. *Update: V2 of the Affinity Suite is now available.*
- [Topaz Photo AI](https://www.topazlabs.com): I originally used Topaz Sharpen AI and found it gave me stallar results compared to every other piece of AI-Sharpening software out there. With Topaz Photo AI, you get Apple Photos integration, more versatile batch processing options, and the entire Topaz suite rolled into one click. Highly recommended.
- [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/): I use Pixelmator on the iPad, not my Mac - but can highly recommend it for ease of editing images (there's a really fun subject/background selection tool)

### Design

I don't really use these extensively. I got Affinity on a **huge** discount, and prefer the fact that it's a one-time-payment as opposed to Adobe's equivalent.
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/)
- [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/)
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org): SVG editor, recently released v1.0

# System Modifications

#### Regular Use

These are little mods that you'll use right up front (with keyboard shortcuts or the like) they change workflows a little.

- [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12): Nice snap-to-corner window manager making it a bit more windows-esque, free alternative is [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com).
- [Colormate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colormate-picker-organizer/id1514980873?mt=12): Allows picking colours and copying them from anywhere on the screen - has turned out to be incredibly useful!
- [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app): The shortcut ⌘+⇧+2 lets you select an area of your screen and converts images to text very quickly and actually fairly accurately.
- [Hungrymark](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/hungrymark/id1482778901?mt=12): Really cool bookmark button for websites, files, apps, lots of things you can use!
- [ViMac](https://vimacapp.com): Keyboard scrolling, replaces little shortcuts and checkboxes with letter keys, makes it super easy to use vim-like shortcuts in most of the mac environment.
- [Cheatsheet](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/43222/cheatsheet): Hold down ⌘ to view all shortcuts in basically any app or screen in your mac
- [Dato](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12): Fairly convenient clock/calendar replacement that offers good customisation.

#### Background

These exist in the background a little more - you'll probably notice they're gone more than you'll notice than they're around, but YMMV.

- [Glance](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/glance): Gives some much nicer markup for things like Python/Markdown files. This one lives in the background and works beautifully without you ever really noticing.
- [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole): BlackHole is a modern MacOS virtual audio driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency.
- [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12):Keeps your mac on permanently if you need to run renders etc. while AFK, with pretty good granular control. A paid alternative I've used before is [Lungo](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app-bundle/sindres-menu-bar-bundle/id1439413445?mt=12).
- [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org): Karibiner does desktop shortcuts. I've used it almost exclusively to map my mouse keys to switch between virtual desktops (workspaces), because I realised I use that a LOT when I was working with a touchpad. *Update: I've stopped using this now, since Logi+ provides sufficient control to do the shortcuts that I most commonly use.*
- [Mos](https://mos.caldis.me): Smooth scrolling with the mouse on mac, and allows for the correct scroll direction (as opposed to "natural"). Apple has this natively in settings, and I have stopped using Mos since upgrading my mouse to a newer Logitech one - Logi+ has the same features as Mos.
- [Dozer](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer): Hide menu bar icons to give your Mac a cleaner look.

#### Utility

These bits do maintenance and help to run other little things that might be used once every few days/weeks.

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org): Virtual Machine, good to run Windows when compiling for some binaries or other. *Update: I've upgraded to [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com), which is expensive, but amazing for Apple Silicon macs.*
- [Onyx](https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html): Use for maintenance/cleaning tasks.
- [TinkerTool](https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html): Access to additional preference settings Apple has built into macOS.
- [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/app/thanks): Basically a native translation interface that uses DeepL - with a nice clean interface.
- [CleanShotX](https://cleanshot.com): Great screenshotting interface. I like the native interface but things like scrolling capture have turned out to be pretty great additions.
- [Aerial](https://aerialscreensaver.github.io): Screensaver application that lets you play Aerial videos from Apple's tvOS screensaver. *Update: Aerial now has a fancy ass website!*
- [Pipifier for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/pipifier-pip-for-nearly-every-video/id1160374471?mt=12): Allows for Picture-in-picture views in Netflix, YouTube and *most* other websites. *Update: This is now pretty much one of my most-used bits of software.*
- [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html): After going through a bunch of different ad blockers, this has turned out to be by far the best. Although I use the system-wide version (that's paid), you can also use [‎AdGuard for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/adguard-for-safari/id1440147259?mt=12), available on the App Store. *Update: Activete DNS Protection to get faster internet*
- [VPN Unlimited](https://www.vpnunlimitedapp.com): VPN Client of choice, mostly because I got the lifetime subscription for cheap. This runs system-wide and not just in Safari, so it works with all other apps too.

# Hardware

These are either drivers or software that works specifically with certain hardware.

- [Veikk Drivers](https://www.veikk.com/nav/14.html): Download for the super cheap drawing tablet I bought.
- [Repaper Studio](https://www.iskn.co/repaper/app/): I use this with the Slate - probably not for everyone else.
- [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/): Can be used to write image files to MicroSD cards. I use this with Raspberry Pi projects.
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software): The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload it to the board.
- [OM Workspace](https://support.olympus-imaging.com/owdownload/): I take pictures with an OM Systems OM-1, and this software is free, and has some really fancy features specific to OM Systems cameras (such as denoise) that no other software has.

# Games

Gaming on Mac has gotten significantly better. Apple Arcade offers a wealth of games (many of them are actually identical to those on the Nintendo Switch) - grab a controller for your Mac and you can hand-off progress with your phone.

- [Battle.net](https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/?ref=battle.net): Starcraft II runs on Mac (in Metal), and is pretty slick.
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com): If you're coming from a windows gaming machine, it is likely you'd be able to find some games already written for Metal, or ported for Mac by [Feral Interactive](https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/).
- [nVidia GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/geforce-now/): I have found that cloud gaming is not only viable, but a fantastic and cheaper alternative than building an expensive PC (especially now that I hardly have time to actually game). GeForce Now works for me, but the other ideal alternative would be [XBox Cloud](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play).

# Programming & AI Tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com): I use VSCode to run and compile most of my mini Python projects.
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com): Use to manage and push updates to github repos.
- [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/): Pretty much the best file transfer app I have ever used. It works flawlessly, and has a super-clean GUI.

### Utility Websites

- [Neuromorphism](https://neumorphism.io/#e0e0e0): If you code CSS and hate trial-and-erroring corners and shading colours, use this.
- [TinyWow](https://tinywow.com): I've not used this all that much, but it offers a bunch of PDF and Image tools that could be useful to rush projects.

### AI Tools

It's 2023 - of course there's a list of AI Tools I use to speed up my work process. This is just the top three most-fun ways that I deploy AI Tools (mostly because what I do is generally text-based).

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com): Needs no introduction. I use this, pretty much more than the rest of the list combined.
- [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT): From the GitHub repo: *Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM "thoughts", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.*
- [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html): Offline version of ChatGPT, basically.

# Other

### Python

I use python for quick-and-dirty jobs. These libraries are either ML stuff (I've taken an interest in it, or other utility libraries I've found useful in work/play) that I wouldn't remember exist normally (obviously numpy needs no introduction).

- [PDF2SVG](http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg/): Converts any old PDFs to vector graphics - has turned out to be super useful.
- [PyFiglet](https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet/tree/master/pyfiglet/fonts): Great little library to make cool header text.
- [Cowsay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay): Another great little cool ASCII art text library.

### No Longer Using, but still great bits of software:

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com): Python distribution of choice - I also prefer Spyder over Pycharm.
- [Kite](https://kite.com): Great little tool to do autocomplete in lots of editors.
- [PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac): Other Python.
- [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com)
